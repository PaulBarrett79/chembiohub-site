		<h2 class="subheading text-center">What's the problem?</h2>
		<!-- <p class="nexa">A brief explanation of what chemistry registration is and why it is important - how it drives reproducible results and ultimately good papers. Promotes good practice in academic labs - this kind of thing is standard in industry. One unique ID can hold a wealth of information - more than just lab location</p> -->
		<p class="nexa">Research groups spend precious time and effort getting raw instrument data into a useful format. Having a lot of manual steps means the risk of introducing errors is high.  If that results in mis-reporting of the research, the implications can be huge for the whole scientific community.  As a starting point we addressed the process of interpreting Alphascreen data, which suffered from all of these problems.  Since we know there are many labs throughout the University running AlphaScreen assays, it seemed sensible to develop something which could help a number of different groups.</p>
		<p class="nexa">The ChemBio Hub team produced a way of helping researchers to gain confidence in their analysis and interpretation of the data and to win back time which can then be spent on science rather than data-processing.</p>

		<h2 class="subheading text-center">What is ChemBio Hub Crunch?</h2>
		<!-- <p class="nexa">A brief explanation of why this project started, talk about how this links in with collaborations across non-chemistry departments, the fact that there is little/no good free software to do this job for academia</p> -->
		<p class="nexa">ChemBio Crunch is an assay data analyser. To use it, simply load your assay data direct from the plate reader and you can immediately see the results in a heatmap.  It is then simple to confirm your expectations by eye - spotting outliers and unexpected results.  With a single click you can then generate the IC50 curves. No cutting and pasting, no merging of spreadsheets, no navigating between various applications.</p>

		<p class="nexa">Do you know about research support tools that we should be sharing with ChemBio Hub users?  Perhaps you’ve even created some?  Please drop us a line or give us a call and we will be happy to feature those.</p>

		<p class="nexa">Do you have data management issues?  Whether storing raw data, cleansing and interpreting assay output, visualising results, preparing for publication, deposition or archiving, please get in touch.</p>

		<p class="nexa">Can you help define good practice?  You can help other scientists by sharing tools, techniques or workflows that work well for you. The chances are high that others could benefit from knowing what you do well. We’d love to feature your research practices and encourage collaborations between complementary disciplines.</p>
