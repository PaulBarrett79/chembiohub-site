Metabolism encompasses the biochemical reactions that our cells and bodies use to generate energy and the molecular building blocks for growth.  By understanding how metabolic pathways function in tumors and other diseases we can better identify therapeutic targets for intervention in cancer and other diseases. Currently I’m investigating the regulation and function of reductive tricarboxylic acid (TCA) metabolism in human cells, the role of hypoxia and extracellular matrix in reprogramming metabolic pathways by using a combination of computational and analytical tools including stable isotope tracers and mass spectrometry to quantify metabolic fluxes in cells."

    bio: "Patients with mutations in the Mixed Lineage Leukaemia (MLL) gene do not respond well to conventional therapies and thus have very poor survival rates. This is likely due to the fact that MLL is a master regulator that modifies the “epigenetic” information content of a cell. The overall goal of the Milne lab is to use MLL leukaemias as a system to identify and analyze novel epigenetic pathways in leukaemia and to understand how they interact with transcription factor networks. The end goal will be to use this information to identify potentially novel druggable targets."

We have developed a protocol to derive authentic macrophages from pluripotent stem cells and have used these cells to genetically and chemically unpick the mechanism by which HIV-1 enters these cells. We are also pursuing CRISPR-based technology to identify novel genes involved in HIV-1 infection of macrophages, as well as those required for stem cell maintenance - which could provide excellent drug targets to improve stem cell culture as well as identify potential therapeutic targets."

    bio: "Antisense transcripts encoded on the opposite strand of protein-coding genes are a major focus for the regulation of gene expression and are suspected to modulate the expression of their corresponding sense transcripts. We have identified an antisense transcript, which overlaps the 3’ end of the α-synuclein gene (SNCA) which is implicated in Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Here, the expression of this antisense transcript was studied and we confirmed its expression in HEK293, SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) derived from PD patient fibroblasts. Investigating the role of this antisense transcript in healthy individuals and PD patients may give insights into a previously unknown mechanism of SNCA regulation."

Of current interest is developing a chemoproteomic pulldown assay to analyse the potency of inhibitors of the bromodomain BRPF1B in mammalian cells. Using immobilised derivatives of a BRPF1B inhibitor, BRPF1B can be isolated from cell lysate and detected using Western blot and quantified using LCMS/MS. The inhibition of BRPF1B by small molecules in cells can, therefore, be observed and quantified using LCMS/MS."

We have used cell cycle markers and specific small molecule inhibitors of DNA repair proteins to investigate the effects on DNA repair kinetics by visualising fluorescently tagged proteins in real time. Future development of the 6 MeV linear accelerator into a medium throughput radiation and imaging facility will allow potential cellular targets to be investigated in live mammalian cells."

In particular, we are trying to understand how UGGT (the enzyme responsible for the quality control of all proteins secreted by eukaryotic cells) can do its job at all: imagine a single molecule in charge of checking on hundreds of differently shaped molecules, and being able to flag them for retention in the cell if they are incorrectly folded. A molecular mystery! That, or the current model about UGGT needs improving. My colleagues and I think we should find a drug to inhibit UGGT in individuals suffering from certain genetic diseases. We hope to be able to prove this idea right or wrong."

    bio: "Caspases are cysteine proteases that play an important role in the process of apoptosis. These enzymes are inactive in normal cells and they become activated through cleavage of an inactive precursor that constitute the active enzymes and engage in cell digestion of anticancer cells. Betulinic acid is a pentacyclic triterpenoid of natural origin and was isolated from plants such as Tryphyllum peltatum. Treatment of cancer cell lines with betulinic acid results in cell shrinkage, DNA fragmentation and caspase activation. Ferruginol is a structurally related tricyclic diterpene and also showed caspase activation by affecting the apoptosis inducing factor and its translocalisation into the nucleus."

Three areas of interest are Parkinson's disease (PD), Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) and familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). All three projects use phenotype-based cellular screens to identify new targets or new therapeutic small molecules. We have recently published a screen to identify a novel therapeutic compound for FRDA; we have identified and worked up a new therapeutic small molecule for FH with potential advantages over statins; and in PD, we have developed a major program in disease modelling using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and have identified phenotypes in patient-derived neurons suitable for target discovery screens."
