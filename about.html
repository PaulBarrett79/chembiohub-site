		    		Project Goals
				</h2>
				<p>
				<h4>To establish a hub to publicise and share results in target discovery research, the first of its kind in the UK, which will work to reduce duplication and wastage in the drug discovery process. </h4>
				</p>
				<p>A key aspect of the development of new medicines is the accurate identification of what components within a cell those medicines interact with. These ‘targets’ are proteins which play important roles such as how the cell will behave, when it will replicate and when it will die. It is important to understand the way these targets work within cells to indicate where potential new drugs might act.  Also, it can flag up unintentional targets which could be activated by new medicines and might cause side-effects, sometimes with serious consequences to the patient.</p>
				<p>It is critical to screen possible new medicines against targets using experimental methods as early as possible in the drug discovery process. The data from these experiments is extremely valuable to other researchers both in academia and in the pharmaceutical industry. As the amount of data generated within the University increases, it is essential to capture and share that information using a central database which is accessible both to the researchers within the University but also publically where appropriate. Currently there are many ways individual research groups capture such data within the University but it is not shared, often for technical reasons. The ChemBio Hub will implement a web-based solution, the first of its kind in the UK, which allows researchers to upload their results, compare their data with results from others and discover new opportunities to collaborate, so reducing wastage and duplication of effort. This will ensure that more rational target selection decisions are taken resulting in better medicines being developed more quickly.</p>
				<p>Public funders increasingly make it a mandatory condition that all of the data coming out of projects they support must be made publically available. This tailor-made platform will demonstrate that the University takes this requirement very seriously, making it clear to funders, other academic organisations and industrial partners that we aim to make findings much less obscure and more discoverable.  By leading the way in this approach the University will be better able to attract public and private funding and link research groups with biotech and pharmaceutical companies with an interest in progressing the research into novel medicines.</p>

		    		Funding was provided as follows:

				<p>
				<h4> Higher Education Funding Council</h4>

				<p>
				<img src="/assets/img/funders/hefce.png" class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4"/>	The <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/whatwedo/kes/heif/" onclick='return !window.open(this.href);'>Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE)</a> has contributed £100,000 from the Higher Education Innovation Funding (HEIF).  This is specifically in support of knowledge exchange activities between the University and the wider world, aimed at providing economic and social benefit to the UK.  This contribution funds the appointment of a Knowledge Exchange Coordinator with the role of championing the use of the ChemBio Hub platform.  
				</p>
				<p>
				The <a href="mailto:michael.ohagan@chembiohub.ox.ac.uk">KE Coordinator</a> acts as a central coordinator for medicinal chemistry and chemical biology knowledge within the University, assisting in bringing together groups from various Divisions and Departments, increasing collaboration and reducing duplication of effort.  His role includes maximising the transfer of knowledge not only within the University but also with external organisations, so increasing the impact of the science generated and providing new opportunities to further develop the increasing role the University plays in drug discovery internationally.

				<h4> Wellcome trust ISSF</h4>
				</p>

				<img src="/assets/img/funders/welcome.png" class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4"/>
				The ISSF commissioned a series of audits of strategic equipment within the University, led by leading researchers.  These included <a href="http://www.issf.ox.ac.uk/_asset/file/small-molecule-audit.pdf" onclick='return !window.open(this.href);'>one focused on small molecules in biomedical research</a>, headed by Dr Paul Brennan and published in April 2013.  One key finding of that audit was that “It is currently very difficult for one research group within the University to know if another group has expertise in a certain assay or screening technique. There is also no mechanism for one group to know if another group has compounds of interest for either target discovery or lead discovery.”  Following this finding, the ISSF then provided a total of £270,000 of funding to support development of a University-wide Chemical Biology data and reagent sharing platform, which subsequently became known as ChemBio Hub.

				<p><img src="/assets/img/funders/ndm.png" class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4"/>
				The <a href="http://ndm.ox.ac.uk" onclick='return !window.open(this.href);'>Nuffield Department of Medicine</a> is providing £50,000 of funding in support of the project.

				<h4> John Fell Fund</h4>

				<p><img src="/assets/img/funders/johnfell.png" class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4"/>
				The <a href="http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/pras/jff/about" onclick='return !window.open(this.href);' >John Fell Fund</a> is providing £125,000 of matching funding to support the ChemBio Hub project. Sharing of data resulting from various screening programmes throughout the University is currently ad-hoc – perhaps by emailing of Excel spreadsheets and reliant on informal knowledge of what is happening within various departments. The John Fell funding is targeted at resolving the critical need to record and share data by providing a central platform for chemical biology data.
