		<h2 class="subheading">What’s the problem?</h2>
		<p class="nexa">Research groups don’t always have a comprehensive way of collecting information about the molecules in their laboratories.  Without a unique identifier and systematic record-keeping, information about compounds can be incomplete, duplicated, isolated and unvalidated. All of this can lead to duplication of effort, scientific advances being left unpublished and researchers running the risk of funding being withdrawn when they can’t demonstrate compliance with data management mandates</p>

		<p class="nexa">Ultimately all compounds should be deposited in the public compound repositories, but there is typically a gap between first synthesis and publication while researchers investigate the key characteristics and potential applications.  We aim to make managing of compound data during this period (and beyond) simple and secure, as well as simplifying the process of data deposition.</p>

		<h2 class="subheading">What is ChemBio Hub ChemReg?</h2>
		<p class="nexa">ChemReg allows groups to manage and search their compound data securely.  You can import a file of chemical compounds in a variety of standard formats, or draw molecules directly within the application.  Each unique compound is then recorded, given an identifier and validated.  We provide security and configurable validation within each secure project.  That means that your administrators can define who has access to your project to create, view and update the compound information, as well as what information is needed as a minimum for each compound. The ChemBio Hub team can provide curation support to ensure data is recorded consistently and in line with the standard repositories.  This means that the process of depositing data into ChEMBL and PubChem is greatly simplified and you will find getting data ready for publication is also much easier. </p>

		<p class="nexa">You will be able to demonstrate to funding bodies that your data management policy is robust and fully compliant with their requirements, saving an administrative task to gather the evidence that you do meet the ever more stringent standards, and preventing the risk of having a grant application fail on this vital requirement.</p>
