symp2015:  
  title: Current expertise and future directions in drug discovery
  overview:
    - paragraph: "This event showcases top chemical biology research from labs at Oxford.  Particular emphasis is placed on linking basic chemical biology research to work in the clinic."
      order: 1

    - paragraph: "The first session of the day looks at disease-agnostic technologies to aid drug discovery. The second session features work on targets and pathways applied to a variety of illnesses. The third session focuses on therapeutic interventions for neurodegenerative diseases."
      order: 2

    - paragraph: "Each session features top-class science presentations from a broad range of Oxfordâ€™s biomedical and physical science departments, with speakers from industry giving their perspective throughout the day. This sets the stage for a round-table discussion between opinion leaders from across Oxford and industry. The conversation will focus on how we can best work together to translate ideas into new medicines."
      order: 3

    - paragraph: "The symposium will bring together 200 delegates including Oxford researchers, industry colleagues and technology transfer professionals. In doing so, it will provide the ideal forum for discussion and lead to lasting collaborative relationships."
      order: 4

    - paragraph: "Networking breaks and poster sessions will allow discussion to continue outside of the lecture theatre. The day will finish with a wine reception in the common room of the Andrew Wiles building, which provides a beautiful view of the 18th century Radcliffe Observatory."
      order: 5
  programme_intro: "We are finalising the agenda and will publish it here on Wednesday 15th April. On the day, coffee will be served from 9am at the Andrew Wiles Building. Andrew Hamilton (Vice Chancellor of the University of Oxford) will open the event at 9.30am. The evening wine reception will finish at 7pm."
