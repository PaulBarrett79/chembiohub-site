symp2015:  
  title: Current expertise and future directions in drug discovery
  overview:
    - paragraph: "This event will showcase top chemical biology research from labs at Oxford.  Particular emphasis will be placed on linking basic chemical biology research to work in the clinic."
      order: 1
      
    - paragraph: "The first session of the day looks at disease-agnostic technologies to aid drug discovery. The second session features work on target and pathway expertise applied to a variety of illnesses. The third session focuses on therapeutic interventions for neurodegenerative diseases."
      order: 2

    - paragraph: "Each session will feature top-class science from a broad range of Oxfordâ€™s biomedical and physical science departments, with speakers from industry giving their perspective throughout the day. This will set the stage for a round-table discussion between opinion leaders from across Oxford and industry. This conversation will focus on how we can best work together to translate ideas into new medicines."
      order: 3

    - paragraph: "The symposium will bring together 200 delegates including Oxford researchers, industry colleagues and technology transfer professionals. In doing so, it will provide the ideal forum for discussion and lead to lasting collaborative relationships."
      order: 4

    - paragraph: "Networking breaks and poster sessions will facilitate discussion outside of the lecture theatre. The day will conclude with a wine reception in the common room of the state-of-the-art Andrew Wiles building."
      order: 5
