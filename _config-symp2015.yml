symp2015:  
  title: Current expertise and future directions in drug discovery
  overview:
    - paragraph: "This event will showcase top chemical biology research from labs at Oxford. Focus topics will include disease-agnostic technologies to aid drug discovery, target and pathway expertise across diseases, and therapeutic intervention for neurodegenerative illnesses. Particular emphasis will be placed on linking basic chemical biology research to work in the clinic."
      order: 1

    - paragraph: "The symposium will bring together 200 delegates including Oxford researchers, industry colleagues and technology transfer professionals. In doing so, it will provide the ideal forum for discussion and lead to lasting collaborative relationships."
      order: 2

    - paragraph: "Each session will feature top-class science from a broad range of Oxfordâ€™s biomedical and physical science departments. Complementary speakers from industry will also give their perspective throughout the day, setting the stage for a round-table discussion between opinion leaders from across Oxford and industry. This conversation will focus on how we can best work together to translate new ideas into pioneer medicines."
      order: 3

    - paragraph: "The day will conclude with a networking wine reception in the common room of the state-of-the-art Andrew Wiles building."
