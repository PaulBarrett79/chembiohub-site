## One week to go! Current Expertise and Future Directions In Drug Discovery

### An Oxford-Industry conversation

We are making the final preparations for our symposium “Current Expertise and Future Directions in Drug Discovery: An Oxford-Industry Conversation” taking place in Oxford next Friday, 31st July.

We will be welcoming **70 industry representatives** from over 30 organisations at Vice-President and CEO level, as well as **70 Oxford research group leaders from 20 departments**. 50 post-doctoral researchers and DPhil students will be **presenting posters**, and we will also be joined by **technology transfer professionals** from Isis Innovation and specialists in knowledge exchange and business development. The tag cloud below shows the rich diversity of participants that will be there on the day.

The symposium will be a great place to have the **right conversations** that lead to **new ideas** and **new research connections** between Oxford and drug discovery groups from the Thames Valley region as well as national and international representatives.

After opening remarks from **Professor Andrew Hamilton, FRS** (Vice Chancellor, University of Oxford), we will hear **13 very different talks** from speakers from 11 departments across the University with wide-ranging interests in drug discovery including phenotypic screening, target identification, disease pathway elucidation, clinical validation and more. We are also looking forward to hearing **viewpoints from two industry specialists**. 

You can see the full programme <<here>>. Don’t forget to have your say on Twitter using the symposium hashtag **#OxCBH**.

After the presentation sessions we will have an **open discussion** between academics from Oxford and colleagues from industry.  Directed by questions from the audience, the panel will explore how Oxford and drug discovery organisations can best work together to translate ideas into new medicines. If you are attending the event, **why not prepare a question to pose to the panel**?

The conversation will continue over an **evening reception** in the upper common room of the Andrew Wiles Mathematics Building. This will provide the ideal opportunity to make more connections over a glass of wine and stunning view of the Radcliffe Observatory (below). What better opportunity to arrange further discussions to explore new collaboration ideas?

We hope you are as excited about this unique event as much as we are, and look forward to welcoming you in Oxford next Friday.
