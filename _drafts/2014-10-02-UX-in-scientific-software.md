## UX in Scientific Software

On Tuesday (30th September) Karen, Andrew and myself attended a [UX Oxford](http://www.meetup.com/UX-Oxford/) talk by Roman Pichler [(@romanpichler)](http://twitter.com/romanpichler) entitled "UX and Scrum". The slides have been made available [here](http://www.slideshare.net/romanpichler/ux-and-scrum).  In the talk there were a number of interesting ideas put forward relating to UX (User Experience) in terms of project planning - when to start thinking about UX planning, ideas on how UX can fit an agile/scrum workflow and how to reliably keep track of and advance UX plans and ideas.

**Some key concepts from the talk**
One interesting idea was that of the persona, complimentary to a user story. This describes a target user type in more detail, outlining what they hope to get out of the system and how they may use the system, rather than describing one specific linear process. Roman has constructed a template for building personas which can be found [here](http://www.romanpichler.com/tools/persona-template/). More information on personas in project planning can be found [here](http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/personas.html).

Another concept was that of the Product Canvas. This image is taken directly from the slideshare presentation linked above.

The idea is to list personas next to high level ideas and functionality, epics and any other "regular" aspect of project or sprint planning, as well as work to be done in the next sprint or fully visualised UX designs. This caanvas layout is intended for the early stages of planning but is useful for keeping track of initial good ideas which can be lost due to early difficulty in implementing or lying slightly outside the scope of the project at the start.

Attending this talk was useful in forcing us to think about how UX was important in the work we do. For myself in particular, it made me think about UX in scientific software.

**what makes good UX for scientific software?**
Firstly, good UX is not simply about adding eye candy or new technology - this can help but is not the be all and end all.

**what makes bad UX?**
