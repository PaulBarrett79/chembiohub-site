## Chembiocrunch: A simple tool to analyse and manipulate ChemBio assay data

The eventual goals of the ChemBio Hub project include enabling bench scientists to submit their biological activity data to public databases and to share it  with specific people. When faced with this challenge an obvious research informatics solution would be to create a data repository and to then address the processes required to get data in there.

**We decided the needs of the bench scientist had to come first and went looking for data processing issues**

One frequent challenge we encountered when talking to scientists is summarised in this diagram:
