In order to curate data from scientists it is often nessecary to implement custom fields and tagging features.

A succesful custom fields feature needs all of these characteristics:

<ul>
<li>
Easy to curate - as new fields and values are added it should be possible to update these if done incorrectly and check that they are compatiblle.
</li>
<li>
Easy to use - there should be as little friction as reasonable for those who add data to the system, including editing dropdown lists.
</li>
<li>
Decoupling of data storage in JSON documents from custom fields schema - allows for faster search and keeps database lean.
</li>
<li>
Schema works for validation in front end, back end and potentially NoSQL databases.
</li>
<li>
Forms are derived from the schema without having to code up each variant individually.
</li>
<li>
Schema is extensible to include scientific metadata and is of a well-known standard format.
</li>
</ul>
