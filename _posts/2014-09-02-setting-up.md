As a part of our commitment to provide quality collaborative tools and outreach to the chemical biology community, we have set up this blog to provide some additional information about how we are creating new tools, helping researchers and enabling collaboration.<!-- more -->

We had a look at a number of options for the technology platform we could use for the blog. It had to be something that was lightweight and also editable by the less-technical members of our group. The big CMS platforms, such as Wordpress and Drupal, provide good WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) tools for text entry but are too heavyweight and complicated for what we wanted to achieve. Also considered was [Ghost](http://ghost.org), a lightweight blogging platform written in javascript and node.js - while this fulfilled the remit of being lightweight, and allows users to add content via Markdown, it required another hosting solution to be set up and configured.

A good compromise was found with <a href="http://pages.github.com" onclick='return !window.open(this.href);' >Github Pages</a> and <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" onclick='return !window.open(this.href);'>Jekyll</a>. Jekyll is a lightweight, blog-aware platform which allows users to draft posts for review, publish them, use templating and all the things which developers expect. Plus it has the advantage of being hosted and run on Github - this enables us to have an open source, transparent blog structure that other users can take away and use themselves! Because it uses Markdown, the less-technical members of our group can easily add blog entries for review before they are published and gain an insight into how version control via Github works. That helps the developers explain their work better!

Setting up the blog was a breeze thanks to the great <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages" onclick='return !window.open(this.href);'>documentation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Sites">existing sites</a> that could be used as examples. The most useful of these was <a href="https://github.com/rebase/rebase.github.com"  onclick='return !window.open(this.href);'>Github Rebase</a>[]() with easy to follow code and simple structure.

So now we have a blog, we need to fill it! There will be more articles added here by different members of the team, if you have questions for any of us, just click the author name and send us an email!
