		<p class="nexa">
			The University of Oxford is world-leading in the field of Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery. The <strong>Drug Discovery Oxford</strong> website (<a href="http://drugdiscovery.chem.ox.ac.uk" target="_blank">http://drugdiscovery.chem.ox.ac.uk</a>) was developed to ensure it is easy for external groups to find information about opportunities for collaboration in this area. It provided a well-structured portal for those interested in finding out more about the University’s drug discovery capabilities. However, due to lack of funds and dedicated resources the website has not been updated recently.
		</p>
		<p class="nexa">
			We wish to bring the website up to date and to improve some of the functionality available through the portal. We therefore want to engage an intern to gather together and organise relevant information about the activities of the University in this field, including scientific expertise, disease areas, equipment and technical capabilities.
		</p>
		<p class="nexa">
			The intern will work with the ChemBio Hub project team, liaising closely with Isis Innovation Limited. The initial focus will be on gathering information about development of novel small molecules from various research groups within the Department of Chemistry and updating the website with that information. Over the course of the placement, the intern will gradually extend the data gathering to include other relevant departments conducting similar research.
		</p>
		<p class="nexa">
			There are at least 10 departments where such work is taking place, therefore the applicant will need to be comfortable investigating potentially relevant research and making effective new contacts among key representatives of the various departments and functions to gather the necessary information.
		</p>
		<p class="nexa">
			Key tasks will be to:<br>
			<ul style="font-family: NexaLight;">
				<li>Gather relevant information about efforts in the field of drug discovery and medicinal chemistry within targeted research groups;</li>
				<li>Use University-wide, departmental and research group web pages, publication histories and direct conversations with representatives of each group to collate information;</li>
				<li>Revamp the text of the drug discovery website to bring it up to date. In particular updating and enlarging on the disease areas section, which currently underrepresents the scope and variety of work being done;</li>
				<li>Investigate other research areas relevant to users of the Drug Discovery Oxford website. Examples might be biotherapeutics, other therapeutic entities, vaccines, nanotechnology and clinical capabilities.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p class="nexa">
			The successful candidate would need to have an appropriate understanding of some of the University’s drug-discovery research efforts, in order to be effective in gathering content from an early stage.
		</p>
		<p class="nexa">
			The person should be available from approximately mid-June 2015 for a period of 12 weeks.
		</p>
		<h2 class="blue">Person Specification</h2>
		<p class="nexa">
			Essential:
		</p>
			<ul style="font-family: NexaLight;">
				<li>Good scientific and technical understanding of current chemical biology research, particularly small molecule synthesis</li>
				<li>A team worker who can collaborate with a wide range of colleagues from diverse backgrounds</li>
				<li>Excellent ability to communicate effectively (both spoken and written) with a wide range of people, at a variety of levels of technical knowledge</li>
				<li>Strong organisational skills including the ability to plan ahead, to reprioritise when necessary, and to work to tight deadlines.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="nexa">Desirable:</p>
			<ul style="font-family: NexaLight;">
				<li>An appreciation of some other therapeutic and relevant biotechnologies such as nanotechnology, vaccines, tissue engineering or computational research.</li>
				<li>Experience developing and updating content for websites.</li>
				<li>An understanding of the University’s institutional structures in order to identify and connect with relevant research groups other than those already identified.</li>
			</ul>
		
		<p class="nexa">
			Applications close on Monday 15th June.  For more information about this opportunity please contact Karen Porter on 07867 873426 or email <a href="mailto:karen.porter@chembiohub.ox.ac.uk">karen.porter@chembiohub.ox.ac.uk</a>
